# MovieBase

## Frameworks Used
* [redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) - Used so that application state communication doesn't suck :).
* [react-selectize](https://github.com/furqanZafar/react-selectize) - Used for the selects on the MovieForm. Mainly for auto-complete functionality and for nice multi-selects.
* [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Used for http requests. Wanted to have an easy way of aborting calls without worrying about browser support.
* [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) - Used for tests. 
* [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) - Used for unique ids of manual movie inserts.

## TODO
* Tests
* Styling
* MovieDB Logo 
* Manual Movie Insert Bugs
